# Final Project Proposal: XR Arcade

Assault on Arcanum

Zachary Baker

## Project Description

This project will be an extension of the work I did for my VR Interaction Research, utilizing the same spellcasting methods along with some new ones, but featuring more interactive gameplay. There will be waves of enemies, including basic grunts and rival wizards, that you have to destroy and deter with your magical arsenal from the towers of your fortress. It'll likely have some tower defense elements as well, being able to summon your own minions and magical traps/defenses.

## Feature Breakdown

In this section please fill out a table or list of the features you plan to implement for this project and how challenging you view them to be for you (on a scale of 1 to 5). Here is an example of the format I am looking for:

1. **Controller Motion Spellcasting**: Cast spells through the motion of your controller (tracing, drawing, aiming, etc.)
    1. **Estimated Challenge - 2.5:** I already have the basics of this system implemented, but there definitely will be challenges in making it work with the new gameplay.
2. **Enemy Waves**: Waves of enemies will spawn and try to reach your tower
    1. **Estimated Challenge - 3.5:** The basic concept with basic, grunt enemies is easy to implement, the challenge will come in the form of interesting enemy variety, for example: evil mages that you have to counterspell in time, or elite enemies that require specific spells/have elemental weaknesses.
3. **Tower Defense**: Conjure your own minions and arcane defenses with the mana gained from killing enemies.
    1. **Estimated Challenge - 4:** The challenge here will be implementing the system allowing for the placement of defenses in a 3D space, and the complexity will scale a lot with the more variety of towers. This is more of a stretch goal, so I'm aiming for a limited scope with this feature.
4. **Moving Between Towers**: Move between different towers of your fortress to have different perspectives of the battlefield
    1. **Estimated Challenge - 1:** This will be done with teleportation, and I don't expect any difficulties here

## Milestones

List here the progress you intend to make by each milestone check point. The dates I have represented here are actual due dates for project submissions. These will also be in class time to get feedback from me and other students, so you must have something ready to test by class on each of these days.

1. **By 11/19** - Implement moving between towers, some additional spellcasting options (or retrofit existing spellcasting methods to work with new gameplay), and have some prototype enemies in waves
2. **By 12/5** - Finish implementing spellcasting options, all desired enemies, and possibly tower defense (probably at least 1-2 towers)

## Influences

1. **Orcs Must Die** - A 3D third-person shooter and tower defense. The similarity here comes from the ability (and necessity) as the player to shoot the enemies themselves without solely relying on the towers they place.
2. **War of Wizards** - (https://www.meta.com/experiences/war-of-wizards/7865834933488042/) Found this game while looking for games that have similar concepts to mine. Very similar with the spellcasting and tower defense elements, although mine will be singleplayer tower defense against waves of enemies rather than multiplayer 1v1, so I think the actual gameplay feel will differ quite a bit.
